#Front-End Forumlation

##Overview

This project contains the blank template of what I use for front-end development projects.

__Why formulation?__ Because I've started to dislike the term "boilerplate", and formulation had a nice ring to it.

##What it's built on

Front-End Formulation is based around the SCSS syntax of [SASS](http://www.sass-lang.com) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) for assisting in CSS development, [Jammit](http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/) for JavaScript packaging, and (optionally) [HAML](http://haml-lang.com/) for writing markup.

##Getting Started

Run `bundle install` to install all necessary gems (see the [Gemfile](https://github.com/markupboy/front-end-forumulation/blob/master/Gemfile) to see what is actually included).

Run `guard` to begin watching the directory for changes to files handled by compass, jammit, or haml.
